    <h1>about me</h1>
    <p>
      I am an engineer who loves to create beautiful art.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am motivated to learn new technologies, particularly in front-end development because it sits between art and engineering. I am also an analyst who has helped companies make data-driven decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my current role at <a href="https://pepperdata.com">Pepperdata</a>, I create data-visulization tools for distributed cluster performance used in big data.
